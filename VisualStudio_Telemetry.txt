Tracing:
When tracing telemetry events, the events are also logged to a local file telemetry.log, which you can view using the Developer: Open Log... command and choosing Telemetry from the dropdown.
Always Restart!!!


If you'd like to view all the possible telemetry events that VS Code could send, you can use the --telemetry flag in the CLI. 

For example, running code --telemetry > telemetry.json && code telemetry.json will create a telemetry.json file in your current working directory and then open it in VS Code. You cannot pipe the output like this, code --telemetry | code -, due to the length of the telemetry report.


Event classification:
SystemMetaData - Values generated by VS Code that are not personally identifiable.

CallstackOrException - Errors caused by failures in program execution. These contain stack traces that have been scrubbed of user paths.

PublicNonPersonalData - User generated data that is available to the public, for example, published extension IDs.

EndUserPseudonymizedInformation - Hashes used to identify a unique user without being able to identify who that user is. For example, a hashed Mac Address.
Event purpose


PerformanceAndHealth - To ensure that VS Code product and services are healthy and fast.

FeatureInsight - To understand feature usage and where to continue development investment.

BusinessInsight - To make decisions related to the business of VS Code, Microsoft, and GitHub.

GoogleAnalyticsId - Used on our website for Google Analytics and tracking page views. These are handled in a more sensitive manner than our normal data.

MacAddressHash - Used to identify a user of VS Code. This is hashed once on the client side and then hashed again on the pipeline side to make it impossible to identify a given user.

none - Data does not require any special handling.
